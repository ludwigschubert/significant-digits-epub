<span style="background: #ffffff;">The family of Nikitas Seyhan had
spent generations in the Taurus Mountains at Külek Boğazı,
watching the pass through the peaks from among the rocky crags. It
was harsh and cold at Külek Boğazı, and there were few Muggles
(or, as Nikitas knew them, “Μύγαλοι”) around. The Seyhans
and the few nearby families had very specific concerns, such as
caring for the kneazles, ensuring there would be sufficient food, and
guarding against giants. They did not live glamorous lives, and had
little contact with the outside world.</span>
</div>
<div style="line-height: 115%; margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: auto; page-break-before: auto;">
<br>
</div>
<div style="line-height: 120%; margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: auto; page-break-before: auto;">
<span style="background: #ffffff;">In a world where every witch and
wizard can Floo and Apparate and portkey and Vanish on a moment’s
whim, this isolation might seem strange -- if not downright stupid.
“Why,” we might ask, “do these foolish people not just travel
to a nearby city and catch up on some of the modern advances?”</span>
</div>
<div style="line-height: 115%; margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: auto; page-break-before: auto;">
<br>
</div>
<div style="line-height: 120%; margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: auto; page-break-before: auto;">

<span style="background: #ffffff;">The Seyhans would have stood to
gain a great deal, had they educated themselves. There were numerous
simple spells that would improve the Seyhan lifestyle. Uncle Alexis
would not have to spend night after night resealing the kneazle pens
if he just knew a few simple wards: he could sleep the dark hours
away in peace after a simple </span><i><span style="background: #ffffff;">Duro</span></i><span style="background: #ffffff;">
turned the walls into stone (let’s see a kneazle try to get out of
</span><i><span style="background: #ffffff;">that!</span></i><span style="background: #ffffff;">).
 And Nikitas himself would have found life much more pleasant with
the trivial spell of </span><i><span style="background: #ffffff;">Lumos</span></i><span style="background: #ffffff;">
-- no more glowstones, just a simple light. </span><i><span style="background: #ffffff;">Lumos</span></i><span style="background: #ffffff;">
had been known in Cappadocia for two hundred years by now… get off
your κώλος and go learn something, Seyhans!</span>
</div>
<div style="line-height: 115%; margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: auto; page-break-before: auto;">
<br>
</div>
<div style="line-height: 120%; margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: auto; page-break-before: auto;">
<span style="background: #ffffff;">A more careful person, of course,
might point out that all the magical forms of travel would require
enormous and risky investments of time and money. Should one of the
Seyhans attempt to locate the nearest wizarding town, far away, based
on rumor from Uncle Alexis and an old book? And once there, do they
beg in their mangled Greek (and no Arabic or Turkish, so good luck
there!) to be given resources and a whole magical education for free?</span>
</div>
<div style="line-height: 115%; margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: auto; page-break-before: auto;">
<br>
</div>
<div style="line-height: 120%; margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: auto; page-break-before: auto;">
<span style="background: #ffffff;">Yes, it is possible that Nikitas
Seyhan and his family might have improved their situation. You might
mock them for their failure. But it would have been difficult and
dangerous for them to make the attempt, and it is better to light a
candle than curse their darkness, you incredibly insensitive ass.</span>
</div>
<div style="line-height: 115%; margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: auto; page-break-before: auto;">
<br>
</div>
<div style="line-height: 120%; margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: auto; page-break-before: auto;">
<span style="background: #ffffff;">Anyway, the facts are this: Nikitas
Seyhan was only vaguely aware of requirements for secrecy, the
presence of a larger magical world, and the existence of the
Exarchate of Cappadocia. And so it was somewhat bewildering when he
was arrested by a team of three wizards and witches (a team that
might be called an “auror trio” in Britain) on charges of
breaking Clause 73 of the International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy.</span>

<span style="background: #ffffff;">AUROR #1: Be quiet, at least, if
you won’t act properly. Which one of you is in supposed to be in
charge of the kneazles? You are in violation of Clause 73 of the
International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy, as written and empowered
by the righteous and good Strategos of the Exarchate.</span>

<span style="background: #ffffff;">AUROR #3: Enough of this. It
doesn't matter, let's just get it done. They don't even understand.
Stun that one and let's go.</span>

<div style="line-height: 120%; margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: auto; page-break-before: auto;">
<span style="background: #ffffff;">And they took Nikitas Seyhan, and
accused him of allowing a kneazle to break loose and run free in
Çiftehan, where dozens of Muggles had the chance to observe the
bizarre, catlike creature. This particular kneazle was a big red one,
knee-high, with long and drooping ears and a brownish streak on its
back, and the Seyhans had certainly been aware that it had gotten
free. They’d been counting on its long whiskers and significant
meat, and had been saddened on its escape (and, they thought, his
inevitable snowbound death).</span>
</div>
<div style="line-height: 115%; margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: auto; page-break-before: auto;">
<br>
</div>
<div style="line-height: 120%; margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: auto; page-break-before: auto;">
<span style="background: #ffffff;">Nikitas never really understood the
proceedings. Every aspect of the trial was beyond his comprehension.
Frightened and confused, he shut down, rather than risk making things
worse for himself (or harming his family further). This was viewed as
stubbornness or defiance or stupidity. A man shouted at him from a
high seat in a room that was warm and close, and he sat as still as a
stone. Nikitas had no wealth or power. He was not related to anyone
important, and he had no allies who could cause any trouble. His only
protection was a system of justice that had seen no major reforms in
a hundred years. Naturally, his fate was sealed.</span>
</div>

</div>
<div style="line-height: 120%; margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: auto; page-break-before: auto;">
<span style="background: #ffffff;">It was a big red wax seal. It was
affixed to Nikitas' death warrant.</span>

<br>
</div>
<div style="line-height: 120%; margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: auto; page-break-before: auto;">
<span style="background: #ffffff;">The investigation and verdict were
all technically true and in keeping with the law, and it would be
false comfort to tell oneself that the only thing at work was the
corruption of the ignorant. There had been moments of real
compassion. One </span><i><span style="background: #ffffff;">sakellarios
</span></i><span style="background: #ffffff;">had even spent a few
precious minutes reaching out to the magistrate involved, to ask for
leniency. But there were good and solid reasons that ensured Nikitas'
verdict.</span>
</div>
<div style="line-height: 120%; margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: auto; page-break-before: auto;">
<br>
</div>
<div style="line-height: 120%; margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: auto; page-break-before: auto;">

</div>
<div style="line-height: 120%; margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: auto; page-break-before: auto;">
<span style="background: #ffffff;">Honoured delegates of this
Confederation of Wizards, even the Supreme Mugwump can attest to
these numbers, as he has verified them himself! The noble Exarchate
of Cappadocia has enforced the Statute with extreme zeal, even going
so far as to condemn these three prisoners to harsh sentences in the
last five years! We take it more seriously than most, and so it is
flatly ignorant to suggest that the son of our righteous and good
</span><i><span style="background: #ffffff;">Strategos </span></i><span style="background: #ffffff;">would
receive anything but strict scrutiny! Those who would make such
accusations in these hallowed halls would be well-advised to look to
their own affairs, and abandon such calumnies!</span>

<span style="background: #ffffff;">These look just like the real
cards, see? Look at the picture, see the good movement? Fudge is
doing the same gesture on his card, the exact same way. I took this
myself and made my own copies. Didn't even take that long. We can do
this for all of them. I'll wrap them up for you, here hand me that.
Heh, look at that donkey in the paper. Face like my ass. Twelve
years, they gave him. Did you hear the one about the Arab who got
twenty years, and when he got out, all he remembered was his
mother-in-law's name? Hahaha! Yeah, mine too. No, give that here,
wrap it tight.</span>

<span style="background: #ffffff;">Twelve years with no changes that
he can remember. He knows there might have been changes that he has
forgotten, and he knows that he has forgotten so many other things as
well. He can't remember what he has lost, though.</span>
</div>
<div style="line-height: 115%; margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: auto; page-break-before: auto;">
<br>

<div style="line-height: 120%; margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: auto; page-break-before: auto;">
<span style="background: #ffffff;">It is dark. Monsters are-</span>
</div>
<div style="line-height: 115%; margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: auto; page-break-before: auto;">

</div>
<div style="line-height: 120%; margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: auto; page-break-before: auto;">
<span style="background: #ffffff;">What? What? There is a loud noise.
It is so loud. It’s like the world is shaking in the hands of some
great deity. Everything shakes, and the rocks underneath him rear up
and shift. One slides out of the wall, and then another. The second
one lands on his hand. It is very heavy, and he chokes on his own
breath. It hurts.</span>
</div>
<div style="line-height: 115%; margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: auto; page-break-before: auto;">
<br>
</div>
<div style="line-height: 120%; margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: auto; page-break-before: auto;">
<span style="background: #ffffff;">A little time passes, and then
there is more shaking. The stones beneath him jump and he is thrown
around. He doesn’t move very far, because his hand is still pinned.
His hand hurts very much, now, but that doesn't matter. It is just
pain. It doesn't matter, because it is still dark, and he can feel
that there are monsters near. And they are eating him.</span>
</div>
<div style="line-height: 115%; margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: auto; page-break-before: auto;">
<br>
</div>
<div style="line-height: 120%; margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: auto; page-break-before: auto;">
<span style="background: #ffffff;">More time passes. He says nothing
now. He is waiting to find out what will happen. There is something
in him, like waiting for something that is not pain. He can’t say
what that might be. But he is waiting.</span>
</div>
<div style="line-height: 115%; margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: auto; page-break-before: auto;">
<br>
</div>
<div style="line-height: 120%; margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: auto; page-break-before: auto;">
<span style="background: #ffffff;">There is a change, now. Something
else is different. He is still exhausted and cold and in tremendous
pain, but that does not matter because something is different. For so
long, for so many years, there was a presence in his chest and head.
It was a strong but gentle hand, holding him close, cradling him into
an intimate embrace and lavishing him with long, tender, toothy
kisses that scraped his soul. Splinters came away from his
raggedness. They were prised free and consumed and savored. He had
lost bits of himself.</span>
</div>
<div style="line-height: 115%; margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: auto; page-break-before: auto;">
<br>
</div>
<div style="line-height: 120%; margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: auto; page-break-before: auto;">
<span style="background: #ffffff;">That touch is gone.</span>
</div>
<div style="line-height: 115%; margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: auto; page-break-before: auto;">
<br>
</div>
<div style="line-height: 120%; margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: auto; page-break-before: auto;">
<span style="background: #ffffff;">It is hard to understand, since
there is nothing to which he can compare it. There had been the touch
of bony hatred, as there always had been, and then it was gone. It is
still gone. And he knows that. He knows that it is gone and he is not
being eaten. He isn't forgetting.</span>
</div>
<div style="line-height: 115%; margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: auto; page-break-before: auto;">
<br>
</div>
<div style="line-height: 120%; margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: auto; page-break-before: auto;">
<span style="background: #ffffff;">He was being eaten, and now he is
not. Existence has been upended: the unstoppable flow of life, which
moved from one pain into a worse pain, has reversed itself. He cannot
feel surprise. There is not enough left of him to feel surprise. He
is stripped and broken, the marrow licked clean from his soul.
Whatever is left cannot quite grasp this event. A law of life has
upended. He is not being eaten.</span>
</div>
<div style="line-height: 115%; margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: auto; page-break-before: auto;">
<br>
</div>
<div style="line-height: 120%; margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: auto; page-break-before: auto;">
<span style="background: #ffffff;">Time passes.  He does not reckon
it.  He is waiting.  Could he move, if he wished it?  It does not
matter, since he does not wish it.  He lies there, hand crushed, and
waits.  Such a curious thing, to know and remember that a good thing
has happened to him.  He has a bruised and shallow mind, and cannot
hold much more than this marvel.  A good thing has happened.  He is
not being eaten.</span>
</div>
<div style="line-height: 115%; margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: auto; page-break-before: auto;">
<br>
</div>
<div style="line-height: 120%; margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: auto; page-break-before: auto;">
<span style="background: #ffffff;">He hears voices.  The door to his
cell opens, and with it comes light.  It is warm and yellow, and he
feels it on his skin.  A woman has the light.  It is coming from her
wand.  He sees the woman.  She is beautiful.  He has nothing to which
he can compare her, but she is beautiful.  She has a tight smile on
her face, and she has brown hair that falls in curls to her
shoulders.  She says something, though it is nonsense to him, and her
voice is music.</span>
</div>
<div style="line-height: 115%; margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: auto; page-break-before: auto;">
<br>
</div>
<div style="line-height: 120%; margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: auto; page-break-before: auto;">
<span style="background: #ffffff;">More people are behind her,
speaking more nonsense.  He does not move very much.  He watches the
woman.  The others are also beautiful, but they are not like her. 
She moves to him, and he feels her push open his jaw and place
something soft in his mouth.  It is sweet -- he knows it, though he
cannot remember it.  He stares at her.  She touches his cheek,
frowning, and then gently strokes his throat.  He swallows. 
Sweetness.</span>
</div>
<div style="line-height: 115%; margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: auto; page-break-before: auto;">
<br>
</div>
<div style="line-height: 120%; margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: auto; page-break-before: auto;">
<span style="background: #ffffff;">At some point, the others had moved
the stone off of his hand, and had done things to him.  The pain is
gone from it, although it had never mattered very much.  It had only
been pain.  He is not being eaten, and what else could matter but
that?</span>

Pip had been an auror for only a year, so he knew very much how lucky he was to be assigned to the Tower. His mother had wept with pride when he’d told her… not even cried a little, but out-and-out bawled. He hadn’t even known what to do, so he just stood next to her and patted her on the back, and said, “Now Mum… now Mum…”<br>
<div style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: auto; page-break-before: auto;">
<br>
</div>
She had turned and clung to him and wailed out something about being so proud of him, and how he would be working with the most important man in the world, and how his father would have been so proud had he not been killed for trying to protect his students, and how Pip was turning out just like him and it was wonderful. Finally she had just clutched him close and said, “Dear Phillip, dear dear dear Phillip, I am so… oh, dear Phillip!”<br>
<div style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: auto; page-break-before: auto;">
<br>
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: auto; page-break-before: auto;">
He knew that she had never been happy these last six months. She was scared for him. He’d been on the three-week Nurmengard rotation. Now he’d be in the guarded clinic compound that was almost literally the safest place on the entire planet, located in an impregnable school and staffed with the best healers history had ever known. The whole situation was basically a mother’s dream. She might <i style="line-height: 100%;">actually</i><span style="line-height: 100%;"> </span>have dreamed this, come to think of it.</div>
<div style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: auto; page-break-before: auto;">
<br>
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: auto; page-break-before: auto;">
Not that he hadn’t earned it, mind you. He had worked himself like a shaggy bobbin to get his NEWTs, pulling<i style="line-height: 100%;">four</i><span style="line-height: 100%;"> </span>Os and an E (stupid Herbology). Pip hadn’t rested on his laurels -- two tries to get into the training program! -- but had done a proper Hufflepuff and slaved away until he thought his wand-waving fingers would fall off.</div>
<div style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: auto; page-break-before: auto;">
<br>
</div>
Hard work had paid off. All those hours twiddling away with Transfiguration had gotten him noticed, pulled off assignment and put in the Tower. Younger than anyone else, as far as he knew, and wasn’t that quite the thing! Every auror here had to be particularly expert at Transfiguration, and he’d been one of Professor McGonagall's star students thanks to many late nights and strained nerves, but this did her proud. He’d owled her his gratitude (it was proper strange he couldn’t just pop down to the rest of Hogwarts to tell her in person, but rules was rules).<br>
<div style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: auto; page-break-before: auto;">
<br>
</div>
He’d make the most of it, now that he was here. He’d put in the hours again, and eventually he’d get noticed by Mr. Diggory or Mad-Eye or even Madame Bones.<br>
<div style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: auto; page-break-before: auto;">
<br>
</div>
Pip stood sharply next to the Tower entrance, doing his best to look both intimidating and invisible. His companion on this shift, J.C., was managing both effortlessly. He could learn a lot from her, really. How in Merlin’s name did she achieve that look of fierce attention and profound boredom? It seemed like a contradiction in terms.<br>
<div style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: auto; page-break-before: auto;">
<br>
</div>
A steady flow of healers and their levitating subjects flowed in and out of the Tower’s entrance, a simple golden doorway. Fairly quiet day, so far.<br>
<div style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: auto; page-break-before: auto;">
<br>
</div>
“Hello?” A man and woman stepped hesitantly through the entrance, peering about curiously. Pip’s wand was already in his hand, but a look through the passage behind them showed that the aurors on guard were holding up today’s handsign. All was well. Pip glanced at J.C., and she just jerked her head at the visitors.<br>
<div style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: auto; page-break-before: auto;">
<br>
</div>
“Hello, sir, ma’am.” Pip said, brightly. “I hope that your trip was pleasant, and that the security precautions didn’t overly inconvenience you.”<br>
<div style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: auto; page-break-before: auto;">
<br>
</div>
The woman gave him a chilly glare (odd bird… skinny and pale), but the man smiled good-naturedly and said, “Oh, it was a bit inconvenient, but I suppose it’s all understandable, isn’t it?” He was a short and lumpy-looking fellow, with thick black hair that sat in random licks along his oily scalp. Nice enough, though.<br>
<div style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: auto; page-break-before: auto;">
<br>
</div>
“Yes, sir. That’s why we aurors are about. The Ministry has assigned us to keep an eye on the Tower and make sure that the important work here is not interrupted. Not a wisp of air gets in without our say-so, sir.” Pip was justifiably proud… and it couldn’t hurt to emphasize the security. Reputation could be the most useful shield of all, as Madame Bones frequently said.<br>
<div style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: auto; page-break-before: auto;">
<br>
</div>
“I’m sure, I’m sure,” the man said, looking around. He didn’t sound convinced. They’d just gone through the main entrance of the Tower, from the Receiving Room in the upper bounds of Hogwarts. Perhaps he hadn’t seen enough to be impressed, or maybe he was just a gorky little fellow who didn’t know enough to be properly awed.<br>
<div style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: auto; page-break-before: auto;">
<br>
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: auto; page-break-before: auto;">
Travel to the Tower was an exceedingly simple matter for the large population that it served these days: touch any Safety Pole or break any Safety Stick, and you went right to the Receiving Room. It was a safe and smooth trip, since the devices were crafted by the most skilled enchanters available on the planet, but it also left you unconscious. If you were conscious on your arrival, which sometimes happened through the usual magical quirks (werewolves and anyone with giantish blood were, for whatever reason, immune to the <i style="line-height: 100%;">Stupefy</i><span style="line-height: 100%;"> </span>laid on the devices) then a friendly team of aurors would assist you with that difficulty. Bottled swarms of chizpurfles and a few dozen Dark Detectors aided the defense team.</div>
<div style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: auto; page-break-before: auto;">
<br>
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: auto; page-break-before: auto;">
Thus far, though, none of the more esoteric precautions had ever seen any use, and they were not widely known. A few werewolves and one half-giant had needed manual stunning and Obliviation, but really it was only Mad-Eye Moody himself who had really tested the matter. He made a habit of trying to break into the Tower and assassinate Mr. Potter. He made an attempt on every odd-numbered day. Security was very high on odd-numbered days, and <i style="line-height: 100%;">extremely</i><span style="line-height: 100%;"> </span>high on even-numbered days (“This’ll be the one!”).</div>
<div style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: auto; page-break-before: auto;">
<br>
</div>
This gentleman, then, had really just touched a portkey, been Stunned into unconsciousness, and then woken up after a friendly and professional auror had scanned and tested him two or three dozen times. He just didn’t know enough to be impressed. The only really visible security would have been the Thieves’ Downfall in the passage from the Receiving Room.<br>
<div style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: auto; page-break-before: auto;">
<br>
</div>
“You have a meeting, sir?” There were often meetings, and often with the most important of people. It was rare for visitors to be complete strangers. Many Ministry officials came for advice and assistance, though the Tower wasn’t actually an official part of the government, and the healers and “scientists” were all well-known (though frequently checked).<br>
<div style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: auto; page-break-before: auto;">
<br>
</div>
The man smiled again. “Ah, yes. I am Councilor Reginald Black-Horse Hig. This is Councilor Limpel Tineagar. We are here on business for the Council of Westphalia.”<br>
<div style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: auto; page-break-before: auto;">
<br>
</div>
Pip looked over at J.C. She had a mirror in front of her, and she was reviewing its display. After a few minutes, she looked up at Pip and nodded. He turned back to the visitors, and said, “Right this way, sir.”<br>
<div style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: auto; page-break-before: auto;">
<br>
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: auto; page-break-before: auto;">
As the three moved down the quadrangular halls, Pip gave the most cursory of tours, out of courtesy. His mother had raised him properly, and she had always said, “Be nice to everyone, since you don’t know who can help you later.” And of course, it could only help the Tower himself when it came to meeting with these two. If they were allowed to be here, then it could only be assumed that it was permissible to see a bit around. Might as well show off the amazing work being done. Nowhere else in the world was there so much magical might and ingenuity, except <i style="line-height: 100%;">maybe</i><span style="line-height: 100%;"> </span>the Ministry of Magic.</div>
<div style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: auto; page-break-before: auto;">
<br>
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: auto; page-break-before: auto;">
“Mr. Potter’s meeting room is just down here, sir. A lot of interesting work being done on the way, though.” Passing a wide side passage, Pip gestured at it. “That’s the Conjuration Conjunction… they’re working on pushing the limits of Gamp’s Law, figuring out the exact point at which something can’t be conjured.” Pip understood the basic idea, although he’d also overheard complete gibberish like “isolating variables” and “conceptual limitation.” But whatever their silly jargon, it would be <i style="line-height: 100%;">ruddy</i><span style="line-height: 100%;"> </span>useful to be able to conjure up a glass of firewhiskey whenever you wanted!</div>
<div style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: auto; page-break-before: auto;">
<br>
</div>
“And here’s the Extension Establishment. They’re doing amazing things with boxes that are bigger on the inside.” Although, for whatever reason, their main activity seemed to be making thinner and taller extended spaces. A cute bloke who worked there sometimes stopped to chat with Pip, and apparently had been very excited that they’d refined the Undetectable Extension Charm to create a small box which had internal dimensions that were too narrow to even fit your hand but as tall as a building. Might be useful to hold a lot of parchment, Pip supposed.<br>
<div style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: auto; page-break-before: auto;">
<br>
</div>
The last department they passed on their way to the meeting room had an open door. Pip and the two Americans could see inside briefly as they walked by, and Mr. Hig jerked to a stop. Inside, two goblins were dipping golden gauntlets into vats of bubbling black liquid, holding their faces back to keep their long noses away from the rising fumes. There was a stench of sulfur, but it didn’t seem to bother the diminutive, well-dressed goblins.<br>
<div style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: auto; page-break-before: auto;">
<br>
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: auto; page-break-before: auto;">
Mr. Hig spoke, saying with surprise, “There <i style="line-height: 100%;">are</i> goblins here.”</div>
<div style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: auto; page-break-before: auto;">
<br>
</div>
“Yes, sir,” Pip said. “There are twenty or twenty-two who work in Material Methods. But if you’ll come right this way…?” The two Americans followed him, Mr. Hig frowning fiercely. Did he not like goblins? Not that Pip really blamed him. All sorts of goblins and centaurs and veela and hags and house-elves had sent emissaries or representatives or the like. Merfolk had even visited, in big glass tanks of water. It made Pip uneasy, perhaps because he’d always been afraid he wouldn’t be able to hack it as an auror, and that he’d end up working in the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures (not that he had anything against them… times had changed, and everyone deserved respect, he reminded himself).<br>
<div style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: auto; page-break-before: auto;">
<br>
</div>
As they arrived at the meeting room, Pip showed them in. Mr. Potter was already in the room, and he approached them. His hair was back in a ponytail, and his robes were formal but unmarked. Mr. Potter’s closet doubtless had much more impressive regalia -- Wizengamot robes, the robes of a Hogwarts professor, whatever a “scientist” wore -- but he generally wore either these plain robes or his Muggle clothing. Mr. Potter gestured at Pip when he was leaving, indicating he should stay. Pip stood along the wall, opposite from the other auror on guard and inwardly glowed. He was getting noticed!<br>
<div style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: auto; page-break-before: auto;">
<br>
</div>
“It’s a pleasure to meet you, Councilor Hig.” Mr. Potter said. The two men shook hands. “And you, Councilor Tineagar.” He shook hands with her as well. They walked together to the meeting room table, and Mr. Potter sat in his usual spot, in front of a few folders and parchments.<br>
<div style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: auto; page-break-before: auto;">
<br>
</div>
“Yes… so, here we are again.” Mr. Hig said, settling into his chair.<br>
<div style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: auto; page-break-before: auto;">
<br>
</div>
Mr. Potter looked surprised at the greeting. To Pip, who had spent a great deal time around Mr. Potter these past few weeks and who was now quite proud of how well he knew the Tower, the expression looked slightly too pronounced. Mr. Potter was wearing his emotions openly, even exaggerating them a bit. “I am not sure that anyone has been in quite this situation, actually, Councilor. We agree on almost everything, and yet we seem to find ourselves in opposition on some small matters. It’s why I was so eager to meet with you.”<br>
<div style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: auto; page-break-before: auto;">
<br>
</div>
Mr. Hig leaned back in his chair, speaking pleasantly but breezily. “I think you might overestimate how much we have in common, if I can be frank, Mr. Potter.”<br>
<div style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: auto; page-break-before: auto;">
<br>
</div>
Mr. Potter smiled. It didn’t touch his eyes. “Councilor, you have spent years working for the protection of Muggles, goblins, and every other sentient creature. That has not gone unnoticed, and you have made many powerful enemies, both here and in the States. You wouldn’t have worked so hard and sacrificed so much unless you clearly believed in the cause. You must know, at this point, that I do, too. Can we not count that as a point in common?”<br>
<div style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: auto; page-break-before: auto;">
<br>
</div>
“We both do say the same things on that score,” Mr. Hig agreed. “In fact, I went to visit several of my allies in Britain earlier today, and I found one of them many years younger, and all of them speaking so highly of you that one might have thought you were Merlin reborn.”<br>
<div style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: auto; page-break-before: auto;">
<br>
</div>
“I hope I haven’t stepped on your toes. But our research here, and the programs we offer in tandem with the Treaty, give us quite a bit of persuasive power. What matters is not who gets it done, but that it gets done, correct?”<br>
<div style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: auto; page-break-before: auto;">
<br>
</div>
Mr. Hig shrugged carelessly. “Yes. But to get down to brass tacks, I have noticed that some of the things you’ve been getting done have been a bit unusual.”<br>
<div style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: auto; page-break-before: auto;">
<br>
</div>
“Unusual?” Mr. Potter asked, raising his eyebrows.<br>
<div style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: auto; page-break-before: auto;">
<br>
</div>
“‘The Center for Applied Thinking.’ ‘The Hinton Foundation.’ ‘The Southern Wetland Preservation Society.’ ‘Habitat for Humanity.’ ‘The Trevor Project.’ ‘The Union of Concerned Scientists.’” Mr. Hig said, then waited. The silence stretched long. Mr. Potter’s expression didn’t change. He folded his hands quietly in front of himself and said nothing. Finally, Mr. Hig added, “I’ll say it, then. These are just a few of the organizations in which you’ve recently bought a leather-lunged voice.”<br>
<div style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: auto; page-break-before: auto;">
<br>
</div>
“And if I had? How would you possibly object to charity?” Mr. Potter asked. His voice was even, but there was a hint of wry amusement.<br>
<div style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: auto; page-break-before: auto;">
<br>
</div>
“These donations come from a single hidden hand, but I know that it is indeed you. Your face is all the confirmation I need. You are buying influence among the Muggles. You are buying people.” Mr. Hig was speaking with sharper words now. Pip listened and watched, fascinated. This was going to be just like one of the stories!<br>
<div style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: auto; page-break-before: auto;">
<br>
</div>
Mr. Potter shook his head. “Then perhaps you have a point of difference here, indeed, since I happen to believe that charitable giving is a worthy pursuit, if you have the means.”<br>
<div style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: auto; page-break-before: auto;">
<br>
</div>
Mr. Hig smiled now, rough black stubble surrounding the expression on his unshaven mouth. “What a remarkably noncommittal statement. Maybe we should turn then to your moves in the trade of magical items?” This next suggestion -- accusation? -- came with a renewed sharpness to his tone.<br>
<div style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: auto; page-break-before: auto;">
<br>
</div>
Mr. Potter smiled, now. It was open and friendly, and his body language shifted to accompany it as he spread his hands before him. “Maybe we can return to that, later? I’d prefer we speak of our political goals, where we might find fewer disagreements. Some people who study these matters have found that it is easier to be pleasant and reach an accord once two parties have addressed matters of common ground. If we begin with these small matters where we disagree, then we-”<br>
<div style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: auto; page-break-before: auto;">
<br>
</div>
“They are not small,” Mr. Hig said, cutting Mr. Potter off.<br>
<div style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: auto; page-break-before: auto;">
<br>
</div>
Pip was astonished that he’d ever thought this nasty little man was pleasant.<br>
<div style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: auto; page-break-before: auto;">
<br>
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: auto; page-break-before: auto;">
“This is your government, and everyone knows that. If you do not actually run it, you own it in all but name. Every major political opponent you have ever faced in Britain is now dead or in hiding,” Mr. Hig said. “And that government has not just doubled inspections of magical trade, it’s increased them <i style="line-height: 100%;">tenfold! </i>The pace of international trade between the Americas and Britain has crawled to a halt! Many powerful wizards and witches in the Council have their money in such ventures, and you are aiming to gradually strangle them into penury. We are known for our magical devices, just as Egypt is known for its alchemy and Britain is known for its culture of wandwork. In other words, you’re trying to diminish our greatest strength, while your own thrives. It is a crude and ineffective move, but that doesn’t make it any less intrusive. You’re expanding and want to clear the way, and I have caught you clear at it. The question is only: what do you want? Do you wish to dominate us, or do you intend to own the Americas right out?”</div>
<div style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: auto; page-break-before: auto;">
<br>
</div>
Mr. Potter’s smile grew wider. “Ah. Well, if we must.” He opened the folder on the table before him. “It does occur to me that I heard that some businesses have been having trouble in the Americas, lately. Let me name some companies, just so I know we’re speaking of the same ones? ‘Queevel’s Quills?’ ‘Musical Merchandising Unlimited?’ ‘Erato Publishing?’” With each name, he turned a sheet of parchment. Mr. Hig’s expression had become a bit fixed.<br>
<div style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: auto; page-break-before: auto;">
<br>
</div>
“These companies,” Mr. Potter continued, “all have something in common. They’re all yours, and they’re all being held up with inspections, lately. You presented a general problem, but really this complaint was tailored to your own needs, not that of your nation.”<br>
<div style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: auto; page-break-before: auto;">
<br>
</div>
“Not one fleck of gold has-” Mr. Hig started, in indignant response.<br>
<div style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: auto; page-break-before: auto;">
<br>
</div>
Mr. Potter continued as if he hadn’t heard. “Not that you own them, or anything so crude. But it has been observed by some friends of mine that they take your orders. I don’t know if it’s a favor-based economy, or what.”<br>
<div style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: auto; page-break-before: auto;">
<br>
</div>
Mr. Hig snorted in derision. “Is that all? I assure you, that while business may look simple to someone who does nothing but meddle in politics and bizarre researches all day, there’s such a thing as working in concert for the benefit of all.”<br>
<div style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: auto; page-break-before: auto;">
<br>
</div>
“Councilor,” said Mr. Potter, “the only things working in concert are the Quotes Quills produced by Mr. Queevel at your direction. Each one has a hidden Protean Charm on it. I can only assume that the other ends of those Charms are linked to quills under your management. Every British wizard or witch -- anyone in the world, in fact -- who buys one of these quills is producing a secret, remote copy of every letter, every receipt, and every love note they compose.”<br>
<div style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: auto; page-break-before: auto;">
<br>
</div>
“Nonsense,” Mr. Hig replied, his lips pressed tight.<br>
<div style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: auto; page-break-before: auto;">
<br>
</div>
“Musical Merchandising Unlimited, on the other hand, makes generally dreadful novelties for different musical acts. I have seen one such novelty… a plate with the promotional image of the group ‘The Weird Sisters.’ It’s a cute device… you sing the first half of a lyric, and the plate sings back the second half of the line, with music. Rather annoying unless you’re a teenaged witch, of course, but even more annoying is the fact that the Open Ears Charm that’s necessary for the plate to function never seems to turn off. Oddly, it seems as though the plate is always listening, and broadcasting the conversations it hears to someone else’s ears. Hard to detect. Useful, though, if you’re the sort of person who values information.”<br>
<div style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: auto; page-break-before: auto;">
<br>
</div>
Mr. Hig said nothing, now. Ms. Tineagar was trying hard not to react. Her jaw was taut with anger.<br>
<div style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: auto; page-break-before: auto;">
<br>
</div>
“Erato Publishing makes books. Mostly short ones about famous wizards from around the world. There’s one about Gilderoy Lockhart, for example. I think I have it somewhere in the office. Well-written, especially the action sequences. When Lockhart fought the vampires, my heart was in my throat.” Mr. Potter’s dry tone of voice made that seem unlikely to Pip. “There’s even an extensive little quiz in the back. You fill it in, and it uses numerology on your name and the personality questions to tell you just how much you’re like Lockhart. Are you 90% similar to the vampire vanquisher? Or just 15%? Curiously, though, the enchantment seems to be recording all of the answers and names somewhere, although it’s devilishly hard to trace exactly where.”<br>
<div style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: auto; page-break-before: auto;">
<br>
</div>
Mr. Potter closed the folder in front of him, and continued, his voice turning cold. “Mr. Hig, when you entered, you said we’d met before. That’s clearly not true. If we’d ever met, you never would have kept trying this sort of thing once you knew I was in charge.” He tapped the folder with his index finger.<br>
<div style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: auto; page-break-before: auto;">
<br>
</div>
There was another long silence. At length, Mr. Hig’s face, which had stiffened and become slightly red to match his plum-like nose, relaxed. He glanced over at Ms. Tineagar, then back at Mr. Potter. Finally, he spoke.<br>
<div style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: auto; page-break-before: auto;">
<br>
</div>
“Oh, I know you. I know you to your core,” Mr. Hig said, leaning forward, his dark eyes glittering. “For I have listened.<br>
<div style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: auto; page-break-before: auto;">
<br>
</div>
“I have heard of a baby whose parents were murdered, and who was famous from infancy for having defeated one of the greatest Dark Lords of history. How did he do it? Why, his mother’s love protected him. How curious that the mothers of Timothy Ghent, Salubria Sintheread, and Geoffrey Bones did not love their children. Lord Voldemort had no trouble with them, or their babies. What unloving and unnatural mothers.<br>
<div style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: auto; page-break-before: auto;">
<br>
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: auto; page-break-before: auto;">
“I have heard of a child who acted and spoke as an adult, and who knew eldritch magics that were not only beyond his age, but beyond any other wizard in known history. This child’s words and confrontations are chronicled in significant detail, often verbatim, by newspapers and books. This child even led armies in play-acting fights with the tactical skill and clever Muggle tricks that might be expected from someone who had lived much longer than he. This child even <i style="line-height: 100%;">frightened Dementors</i><span style="line-height: 100%;">. </span>I might think these incidents and events exaggerated, had I not examined many of the events myself with the aid of significant monies and a Pensieve.</div>
<div style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: auto; page-break-before: auto;">
<br>
</div>
“I have heard of the tragic death of one of this boy’s early rivals, a young girl who had dared defeat him in those play-acting battles and who had dared excel beyond him in scholarly pursuits. She had tragically died a most terrible death, you see, a victim of that same Dark Lord whom he had defeated as an infant, and who had apparently returned.<br>
<div style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: auto; page-break-before: auto;">
<br>
</div>
“I have heard that this boy was also present during a confused and unwitnessed later incident in Azkaban, when the most abhorrent and evil of that Dark Lord’s servants was taken from that prison -- again, with no witnesses ever actually seeing that Dark Lord, who escaped while aided by a Muggle device of considerable scientific advancement. The Dark Lord was not known to have ever used such devices before that time, interestingly, nor known to have had any power over Dementors. And Bellatrix Black… why, she has vanished as completely as if she were dead in a ditch.<br>
<div style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: auto; page-break-before: auto;">
<br>
</div>
“I have heard that this young man was present at some amazing confrontation on a dark night, resulting in the mass murder of some of the most powerful witches and wizards in Britain as well as a Hogwarts professor and leaving behind gruesome severed hands, said to be those of that Dark Lord, and many unidentifiable ashes. So many obstacles vanished for the young man that night, including Lucius Malfoy… and Albus Dumbledore, one of the greatest heroes of this or any age. And his rival reappeared, returned from the dead and now become one of his stoutest allies.<br>
<div style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: auto; page-break-before: auto;">
<br>
</div>
“I have heard that the young man’s rival has the ability to command and destroy Dementors, those darkest of creatures and powerful weapons under the control of others. And that she went to Azkaban at his bidding after the Ministry of Magic balked at his orders to shut down the prison and release the criminals. His rival defeated every auror, destroyed every Dementor, freed every criminal remaining, and razed that prison to sand and ashes. And now she and her army of fanatics act as a law unto themselves, and none can stand against them.<br>
<div style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: auto; page-break-before: auto;">
<br>
</div>
“I have heard the rumors that this young man has, in the years since, shown the power to heal injuries beyond the capabilities of St. Mungo’s or the Russell Center. Lycanthropy, vampirism, missing limbs, and the darkest of curses. What is more, the young man and his healers have the power to grant new youth, a skill beyond that of any other. It is an amazing new method of Transfiguration, I hear, and one of his most prominent healers took an Unbreakable Vow in public to attest that it could not be copied beyond the walls of the Tower. This has not prevented some hushed-up tragedies around the world, as others attempt to emulate the young man nonetheless… all unsuccessfully.<br>
<div style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: auto; page-break-before: auto;">
<br>
</div>
“I have heard that this young man is the secret ruler of Britain, controlling through proxies the proceedings of the Wizengamot, the lesser courts of inquiry, and every action of the Ministry of Magic. The streets are filled with those who are newly young or newly healed, and all of them changed in body and spirit -- remade into new people -- and all of them eager to assist this young man in any way they can. This young man has changed his country, and is now working to extend his reach in countries around the world.<br>
<div style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: auto; page-break-before: auto;">
<br>
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: auto; page-break-before: auto;">
“I have heard that no fewer than eighteen individuals have died within the Tower. They were <i style="line-height: 100%;">not</i><span style="line-height: 100%;"> </span>severely injured, <i style="line-height: 100%;">not</i><span style="line-height: 100%;"> </span>mortally wounded, <i style="line-height: 100%;">not</i><span style="line-height: 100%;"> </span>on the brink of death. I have read testimony and seen with my own eyes the memories that show <i style="line-height: 100%;">at
least</i><span style="line-height: 100%;"> </span>eighteen people <i style="line-height: 100%;">dying</i><span style="line-height: 100%;"> </span>here and passing beyond the Veil. And yet those people were returned from death and restored to life, and they walk the world, youthful once again and completely healthy. Remade. Something only whispered about in the darkest of rituals. And my goodness, do they speak highly of the Tower and his kindness. They’d do anything for him.”</div>
<div style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: auto; page-break-before: auto;">
<br>
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: auto; page-break-before: auto;">
“I have heard so much more. So very much more. And it puzzles me that <i style="line-height: 100%;">so</i><span style="line-height: 100%;"> </span>many seem <i style="line-height: 100%;">so</i><span style="line-height: 100%;"> </span>deaf.”</div>
<div style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: auto; page-break-before: auto;">
<br>
</div>
Throughout it all, Mr. Potter sat silent and stone-faced, listening carefully. Word piled upon word, and accusation upon accusation. Pip could barely believe what he was hearing at this point, Merlin knows… it was outright insanity. Every little fact and weird thing was being spun around on its rear. This American was playing it all up so that it seemed like Mr. Potter was evil, rather than the greatest hero since… well, since Merlin! Pip felt like he was going mad. He knew better than to twitch a muscle. This was craziness and rudeness, but not violence. The other one -- Ms. Tineagar -- seemed almost as shocked as Pip, gaping at her companion.<br>
<div style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: auto; page-break-before: auto;">
<br>
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: auto; page-break-before: auto;">
Pip felt sick to his stomach, as though someone had grabbed his guts and wrenched them with a nasty tug. The most honoured man in Britain -- probably the world!-- and this hairy slug was saying he was Dark? He wanted to grab the idiot and shake him and tell him, <i style="line-height: 100%;">Listen,
you bloody fool, this fellow here has saved more lives than anyone
else in history</i><i>!</i>
</div>
<div style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: auto; page-break-before: auto;">
<br>
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: auto; page-break-before: auto;">
The worst of it was that it made sense, for a second, when he heard it. For just a moment, he’d believed the American, because when all the facts were <i style="line-height: 100%;">twisted</i><span style="line-height: 100%;"> </span>like that, it fit. It was like a line drawing he’d once seen. At first, it had looked like a snake, sinuous body twisting and mouth gaping. But other people saw a phoenix, swirling in fire with feathers spread. And the funny thing was that if you looked at the drawing the right way and <i style="line-height: 100%;">thought</i><span style="line-height: 100%;"> </span>about it the right way, you could make yourself see the phoenix.</div>
<div style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: auto; page-break-before: auto;">
<br>
</div>
But it was crazy. Pip was an auror, trained and trialed -- though new -- and he knew a great deal about Dark Lords. They ruled with pain and terror, and they couldn’t help but look the part. Dark rituals corrupted your soul even as they gave you power. It was one of the fundamental laws of magic: as above, so below.<br>
<div style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: auto; page-break-before: auto;">
<br>
</div>
Trolls and Dementors and flesh-eating slugs were all vicious creatures, and they took pleasure in causing pain as they acted out their natural urges. And sure enough, they were ugly and foul to the eye; the thick mucus of a flesh-eating slug was a pallid yellow that stank like spoiled meat, and you knew in an instant that it was dangerous. Other beings, like giants, were crude and angry but not obviously malicious, and so they were unpleasant and fearsome but not as hideous in appearance.<br>
<div style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: auto; page-break-before: auto;">
<br>
</div>
Pip wasn’t stupid, of course. There were a lot of perfectly nice people who smelled or who were ugly. But you simply couldn’t get away with Dark Magic without it affecting your looks or your aura. You-Know-Who was proof enough of that: pale and noseless and gaunt, as Pip had heard. Harry Potter, on the other hand, was a normal-looking bloke in dark robes, his hair tied back to expose the famous scar. He had glasses, and green eyes. And he was the Tower: Pip had personally seen him heal dozens of people, and not a single person whose life was saved by anyone in the facility left without a smile and a kind word from Mr. Potter.<br>
<div style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: auto; page-break-before: auto;">
<br>
</div>
“And so,” Mr. Hig said, settling back in his chair once more, “you can see that I have been listening, and that I know you very well indeed. You have overplayed your hand -- you have been too provincial. If one is caught up in all the drama of it, it might slip by. But over the sea, we have enough perspective to see the full picture. And every single bit of evidence, every jot and tittle, points to one conclusion. And now that I can look into your eyes, I can see it confirmed. I can see the coldness that I saw once before, one foggy night in Nottingham. It is the coldness of an evil soul.<br>
<div style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: auto; page-break-before: auto;">
<br>
</div>
“You are subtle, but not subtle enough, and now you are undone. I have taken precautions before coming, and soon the whole world will stand against you. For I know you well.<br>
