<strong><strong><br></strong></strong>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">“That is to say: of what possible use can an agent of the Tower be to me?” asked Lord Draco Malfoy of the Noble and Most Ancient House of Malfoy, infamous enemy of the ascendant Government, thorn in the side of the mighty Harry Potter, and increasingly powerful rhetorical force behind the Treaty of Independence.  As he stared at the teenage boy in front of him, his eyes were narrow and his lips tight with contempt.  His ice-blonde hair was almost perfectly styled, but for two stray bits of hair that artfully dipped across his forehead, as though bowing.  He held a silver-topped cane lightly -- almost carelessly -- in his hands.</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">His mother, the Lady Narcissa, stood at his side -- herself a figure of almost as much fame since she suddenly and inexplicably reappeared in British society after more than a decade-long absence (during which she was said to be dead, murdered by former Headmaster Dumbledore).  She smiled pleasantly.</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Lawrence understood, very suddenly and with absolute completeness, just how stupid he and Annabeth had been to get involved with any of this.  To try to frame Sammy Meroveni-Bowles, fool the Tower, and solve a mystery that was clearly </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">way</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> out of their league.  To do anything other than report straight to the Headmistress about </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">everything</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">He tried to answer Draco’s question, but somehow his mouth and throat had gone deadly dry.  Just inhaling to speak tickled the back of his throat, and he shuddered with a cough for a moment, choking it back into a strangle since he was afraid to even </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">cough </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">in front of the Lord and Lady Malfoy.</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The pair did nothing but watch, calmly, which was somehow even more terrifying.  Mr. Erasmus, the red-haired former Tower researcher, seemed uninterested.  He sipped his wine and stared off into space.</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">“I…”  Lawrence struggled to swallow, and then forced himself to continue.  “I brought information.  Things that they’ve found out in the Tower.”  He glanced over at Mr. Erasmus, the man who’d been introduced to him as a former Tower researcher, but Mr. Erasmus appeared more interested in the dram of whiskey that he was swirling around in a stemless glass goblet.</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">“My dear Lawrence,” said Narcissa, smiling.  “The cause of freedom has supporters everywhere.  I cannot imagine you know anything that we do not.”</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">“You are a… fourth year, I believe.”  said Draco.  He didn’t look at Lawrence, instead looking idly at the silver head on the cane in his hands.  “Tell me about the astonishing coincidence or whimsical connection that brought you this information.”</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">“Well, sir, a few days ago one of my classmates, Sammy, was hurt.  He fell.  And I got a Safety Stick to help him -- to get him to the Tower, sir.  But my friend Annabeth was right there, and she helped me.  So we all three went.”  Lawrence spoke smoothly, now, feeling a little better.  This had been rehearsed.</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">“This sounds rehearsed,” said the Lady Narcissa.  Lawrence felt his flesh prickle.</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes, madame… I practiced in front of a mirror before I went to Whizz Hard Books to try to get in touch with the Honourable,” said Lawrence.  Even though he’d been prepared for that observation, thanks to the Tower, who had anticipated it, sweat trickled down the small of his back.</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">“But Annabeth has been angry at the Tower, I think, sir.  Well, I know she has.  We don’t read your newsletter, since it doesn’t seem smart to have it delivered to Hogwarts, but we still hear things.  About how all the rejuvenated people seem too perfect-looking, like dolls, and how they act differently afterwards… like new people.  Like they’ve been replaced.  Annabeth’s oma -- er, her grandmother, sir -- she was just like that.  Annabeth was happy about the rejuvenation, at first, but now she feels like she’s lost her grandmother.  Like it was unnatural.”</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">“Your friend would have preferred her grandmother died, you’re saying?”  Draco seemed doubtful and amused, a slight smile playing on the edges of his lips.</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">“No, sir, but they could have just fixed her, without </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">changing </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">her,” said Lawrence.  He continued his story.  “And so anyway, Annabeth tried to mess things up a little bit when she went along with us.  She had a whole bunch of doxies she’d transfigured down into a rock or something, and--”</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">“And when she went along with you and your injured classmate, they returned to their native Form and ran amok,” said Narcissa, who shook her head, smiling but rueful at the foolishness of children.  “More like a prank than anything serious, it seems to me.  But I have had word of this; it happened.”</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">“Well, sir, I had this with me, when I was in there and they were questioning her, they had me sit and wait.  They put me at a huge table they have there, and told me to be quiet.  And the auror looked away for a minute… and I had this,” said Lawrence.  He reached very, very slowly and carefully into his pocket -- making it clear he wasn’t going for a wand.  Neither of the three adults seemed even slightly concerned.  But they did seem interested when he pulled a golden sphere from his pocket.  “A Time-Turner.”</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">“And since Harry uses his own every day, they don’t ward the Tower against them,” said Draco.  It wasn’t a new realization; he said it as if it were known information.</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">“So I went back an hour, and there was no one there in the past.  I wanted to go look around, but there were just people </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">everywhere</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">, they’re doing so much stuff there… I ended up being stuck in that room, pretty much.  The only place I could go was a little quiet room filled with doors, and even there I didn’t want to stay for more than a minute.  I just… well, I just grabbed some parchments from a desk there, and ran and hid back under the big table.”</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">“And you waited for the auror to bring your past self into the room, and then when your past self vanished--” said Narcissa, nodding.</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">“--I pretended as though I was picking up a piece of parchment from the floor.  He yelled at me, but he seemed nice enough for an auror, and didn’t stun me,” finished Lawrence.  “So… well, here.  This is everything I got.”</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">He reached back into his robes, and pulled out a thick wad of parchments.  They had a crease across their surface, from where they’d been folded in two, earlier.  He offered them to Lord Malfoy.</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Draco didn’t take them, and neither did his mother.  They both glanced at each other for a moment, as though in silent consultation, before the Lord Malfoy finally said, “I’m not sure they would mean much to me, if I can be appropriately humble about my own limits.  Edgar?”  He was smooth in tone and neutral in affect.</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Mr. Erasmus cleared his throat juicily, rising to his feet.  He found a spot for his glass, and approached, rubbing his hands together.  They were small and mottled with uneven red-and-white.  “Certainly, certainly.”  He took the documents from Lawrence, and held one corner pinched with one hand, paging through them with the other.  “Some of Vernon Wells’ work, here… Advancement Agency making great strides, it seems.  It’ll need some study, but they were already talking about this Muggle testing equipment when I left, and this is a Sanger sequence.  They’re looking for genetic marks in Veela blood.”  He paused, then puffed, “Hertability, that was it.  Looking for hertability.  Very technical.  And we knew they were on this, really.  Not interesting.”</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh, it’s all just slips of paper, when you get down to it,” said Draco, drily.  “Anything else that might prove more helpful?”</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">“This says that Richard Keflo Phillips -- squinty fellow, like everything’s blurry all the time, a mouse of a man -- has worked out how to conjure food.  Straight violation of Gamp, though, must be nonsense,” mused Mr. Erasmus.</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">“All right, well, look through it thoroughly, if you wouldn’t mind, and let me know,” said Draco.  “Thank you.”</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Mr. Erasmus returned to his chair, taking the parchments with him.  He muttered quietly, “Marvelous… in such a short time?  My, my…”</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">“Draco, dear, the boy might be telling the truth,” said Narcissa Malfoy, folding her hands in front of herself demurely.  “But it seems more likely that the Tower sacrificed this information about their research -- if any of it is true or useful -- willingly.  A price of passage.  Is that so, young man?”</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Lawrence didn’t trust himself to speak, and only shook his head in the negative.  She turned away from her son to look at him carefully, still smiling, and he felt like he had to pee or throw up (or both).  She could kill him.  He knew it.  She knew that he knew it -- in fact, she knew it so well she didn’t even bother to appear threatening.</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The saving grace was that, even if he hadn’t been trying to deceive them, he would </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">still</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> be this scared, so he didn’t have to try to hide it.</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In the stories about boy heroes like Harry Potter and Reynard Goupil, children could run amok and defeat evil and charge into danger.  There were always people waiting to save them if things really went wrong -- a kindly civilized centaur, or a nurturing headmaster, or someone else.  But children… they weren’t </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">ready</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for this.  This was… he was in over his head...</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s true, Mother,” said Draco.  He lowered one end of the cane in his hands, so that he held it only by the silver snake-head.  He toyed with it, rolling the handle between his palms slowly.  “For you see, Mr. Bradwian, we know quite well that the Tower recruited you after your little time-turning adventure in the Records Room -- if that indeed happened at all.”</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">“He did, sir,” said Lawrence, and his voice cracked on the second word.  He didn’t even feel embarrassed, only worried that it made him seem like he was lying, as he pressed on: “And I said yes.”</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Narcissa laughed, and it sounded quite beautiful and light-hearted.  It was out of place, like a melodious strain of music on the floor of a slaughterhouse.</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">“And you propose to bear back my chosen information, then, Lawrence?  Is that what you’re saying?” asked the Lord Malfoy.  There was a knife in his words, hidden like a slip-tip behind the soft tone.</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes, sir,” said Lawrence, who wished he had never started playing games.</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">“How interesting,” said Draco, who relished them like the air.</span><br>
<strong><strong><br></strong></strong>
<br>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<h4 style="font-weight: 400;">≡≡≡Ω≡≡≡</h4>
</div>
<strong><strong><br></strong></strong>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The three shining spheres, each made of polished silver and standing as tall as Harry, were sitting on simple frames of unvarnished wood.  On each sphere, there were two large holes at opposite ends, with other apertures a handspan apart along different points.  A single low depression, as though someone had pushed their fist gently against the cooling metal, was partway along one side, matched by a similar protrusion on the other.</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Harry touched the surface of one of the silver spheres, reverently.  He was wearing his gloves, but they were fingerless: he let his fingers rest lightly on the metal, which was cool to the touch.</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">After a time spent in contemplation, he dragged a rolling metal podium over.  It bore a long, folded printout in dot-matrix on continuous stationery.  Ugly, but he hadn’t been able to get the much newer and nicer inkjet printers to work correctly.  Harry figured his time was too valuable; he was just going to put five engineers on retainer for the future.  More delegation meant less fun, but he wouldn’t miss some of the tasks… trying to fix the tables on the EEG output had been a nightmare.</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">After consulting the numbers and crudely-drawn graphs on the paper, Harry lifted his wand and touched it to one of the openings on a sphere.  He opened a pouch on his belt, and pulled free the loose end of a thick cord of dense hemp rope -- source material.  Then he concentrated, using the skill that had become as natural as breath.</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Diamond, borosilicate glass, and a single layer of graphite in a honeycomb pattern began to sprout from the contact.  They were crystals joined into a single unit, formed in contravention of all natural processes: nearly transparent and perfect.  It would be an exceptionally good window, fitting deep into wells forged all along the rim of the sphere and anchored in place to an atom’s exactness.</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">He’d considered making the vessels entirely out of such materials (or even some of the “theoretical” materials that he and Hermione had made in their second year, while studying for their O.W.L.s).  But frankly, not even the best materials that science knew could match the mystic strength of goblin-forged silver.  As best he could tell, it was indestructible by all mundane methods.</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">There had been one prototype when making the combat gauntlets used by some of the Returned; Podrad the Artificer had turned out a lobster-looking medieval doodad, in the formal and useless style of ages past.  It would have worked wonderfully for blocking Muggle crossbow bolts in the days when wizards ruled their unmagical kin by force, but it lacked the vital spots for the chargers.  It was a good subject for testing, though -- shear stress, compression, penetration (by CO</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">2</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> laser!), and even a good solid blast of neutrons.  That last one had been entrusted to Luna and Cedric and a hand-picked team, and kept quiet, but the results had been marvelous… the goblin-forged silver had only become more dense, without becoming radioactive.</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">There was probably an outer limit to its mundane durability, but Harry hadn’t yet discovered it.  The humble Sickle was one of the most amazing things the magical world had ever produced.  Wizards, in their bigotry and stupidity, had spent years oppressing goblins, never knowing that staggering power was jingling in their pockets.  Harry could only hope that the rapid restoration of their rights in recent years had been done with enough celerity and forthrightness that it repaired some of the damage.  Goblins had long memories.</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Done.</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Harry stepped back to admire his work, and then stepped forward again, to make sure he’d really done it.  He tapped on the glass.  Nearly transparent and extraordinarily durable… even before enchantment.  Once enchanted, it should be impervious.</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Testing first, though.</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Harry reached over to the dome-shaped depression in the surface of the sphere, and pushed his hand inside of it.  He stepped back to observe as a brown band of color emerged from the slight bulge on the other side of the sphere, expanding away from the center of the bulge.  It widened as it went, and it left nothing in its wake -- the sphere vanished as the band passed.  It looked as though the vessel were evaporating; although, when Harry stepped to the side, he could see that the vanishing flat side of the sphere was now the same brown as the enveloping band.  The flat cross-section of the vessel grew larger and larger, until it passed the widest part of the sphere, and then it shrank down rapidly.</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In a moment, the entire sphere had vanished in the wake of the brownish band, and the flat brown end had revealed itself to be the smooth brown outer surface of a brown leather coin-purse, which had swallowed almost the whole sphere.  As the last of the sphere was placed inside of the purse, it dropped to the ground -- as though, only just then, it realized that gravity applied.</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">“A childhood dream come true?” asked Hermione.  Harry turned to see her leaning against the doorway, smiling fondly at him.  Bouncy brown curls framed her face.</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is going into </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">space</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">,” Harry said, as he leaned down and picked up the pouch.  It was about the shape and weight of a grapefruit.  “I am holding the future in my hand,” he marveled.</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ron Weasley’s future, specifically,” she said, approaching him.  One hand was at her neck, toying with her green-and-gold necklace.  “So I hope the testing has been rigorous.  I wish I could have helped with that, but there’s been a lot to do.”</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">“He’ll be fine, and you’ve contributed more than anyone to this… well, to </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">everything</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> we’ve done.”  Harry put the pouch in the center of the wooden frame, and gestured at it with his two hands, fingers tented together and thrusting out -- as though beginning the breast-stroke.  Obedient to the BSL command, the pouch began disgorging the vessel, which steadily swelled from a silver bowl back into the full sphere.  The brown lip of the pouch, stretching over the surface as the ship was called forth, looked like it was extruding the sphere, as if it were some otherworldly child’s toy.</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Hermione pointed at the next sphere over.  “The bathysphere?”</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">“Well, a bathyscaphe or a submersible… but yes.  It’ll get a cone-shaped front port.  After testing, it will go to the ocean floor… and then, hopefully, right to the bottom of the Challenger Deep, the lowest point on the planet.  No one’s been down there since the Picards in the sixties.  And we’ll be able to explore far better and see more.  We’ll mount viewing mirrors and adjustable spheres with the Perpetual Light Charm on them on the outside, so we’ll be able to take full-colour video, and a bunch of other things.  We’ll even take samples to make portkeys, and we’ll leave a Cabinet down there.  And there’s some things we need to find that were dropped there, as well.”</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">“Okay… but then what is this one?  A second spaceship?”  Hermione pinged the surface of the third sphere with a fingernail.  It had a single slight difference from the first two: there was an additional small recess above the space for the front window.</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">“Something like that,” Harry said.  He lifted a hand, and thumped the surface of the first sphere, hard.  It had fully re-appeared, and the extendable pouch had been swallowed back up in its own turn within the silver lump on the rear of the ship.  The window he’d made seemed to be unaffected.  He set his gloved palm on it for a moment.  “Say, can you scratch these at all?  How do you do on goblin-forged silver?”</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">“My nails are a nine or so on Mohs.  I could probably scratch the window.  But goblin silver?”  Hermione put her thumbnail against the sphere, and dragged it across.  There was no effect.  “That’s why I have that little knife, so I can trim my nails.”</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Harry gathered up a handful of printouts and some other parchments, covered in crabbed notes and designs. “Walk with me?”</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">They exited the room into the larger hall that held the rest of Material Methods, scooting carefully along the wall at one point to avoid a cauldron that was sitting on an extremely hot fire, the magical flames radiating waves of heat.  They nodded and smiled to the goblins and wizards that were busily working in the room.  Urg the Returned stopped what he was doing --  annealing mother-of-pearl to the inside of a charger cartridge -- and called out a greeting.  The sharp-toothed goblin had been there for a couple of days, sorting out some of the finer points on the chargers.</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">“Going well, Urg?” asked Hermione.  Harry didn’t think she knew it, but she always spoke to her Returned in an especially gentle voice.  Not as though they were fragile, but as though they just held some special warmth that she was reflecting back at them: a gentle moon to the bright sun of their devotion to her.</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes,” Urg said, dusting fragments of shiny iridescence from his fingertips.  “Hezekiah from the Extension Establishment spent some time here yesterday, and showed us how to stabilize the extended pocket space within each charger.  They’ll be able to hold much more of whatever we put into them.”  He had a strong Acklish accent -- guttural hoarseness on the velar consonants.</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Hermione picked up the charger he’d been working on, and examined it curiously.  “What’s this for?  Air, foam, water, tear gas, grease…?”</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">“Potions,” said Urg.  “Cure for Common Poisons, Befuddlement Draught, and any of the others that can be breathed in.”</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Harry frowned, leaning over to examine Urg’s workbench.  It was at goblin height, so he had to lean quite a ways over.  “I thought they kept going inert inside the charger?  When we did a prototype with the Muffling Draught, it just shot out like a jet and didn’t function at all.”</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">“The lining,” said Hermione.  “The mother-of-pearl sustains the potion?”</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">“And there’s a nozzle for the front, to mist it,” said Urg.  He went back to the workbench, and held up a small nozzle.  It looked like a copy in metal of a Muggle spray-bottle nozzle.  “The only trick was keeping the Undetectable Extension Charm stable, and I think we’ve solved that.”</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is wonderful, Urg,” Hermione said.  The goblin drew himself up very tall, and nodded, the tips of his long ears bobbing with the motion.</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">“Thank you,” he said.</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’ll let you get back to it,” said Harry.  “But I wonder if you might take a moment, some day next week, to speak to the Science Program students about this?  Not specifics… but just the way you approached the problem.”</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Urg shrugged.  “Yes, if you’d like.  It’s just as the old proverb says...” he said, and accompanied it with a fluent line of Gobbeldegook.  He paused, then translated for the humans: “Make it and break it and make it until it stays made.”</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">“I might need to have that engraved on the wall,” said Harry, as he and Hermione began walking again.  “Thanks.”</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Urg nodded again, and sat back down to his work.  The Tower and the Goddess proceeded out of Material Methods and down the corridor.</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">“We need to change tactics when it comes to Malfoy,” said Harry, as they walked side-by-side down the featureless corridors.  They passed the quiet Records Room, the noisy Conjuration Conjunction, and the humid Vision Verge.</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes… I know about your tactics so far, Harry.  And why you need to change them.  It wasn’t hard to guess,” said Hermione, quietly… a little coldly.</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Harry heard her, but was distracted for a moment.  He ducked back the way they came, and called into the Vision Verge, where the two researchers of that department were concocting a clear, viscous substance, turning it over in thick folds with a large metal spoon.  “Hey!  It doesn’t matter if that mercury is enchanted, the vapours are still toxic!  First degree of caution, please!”</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The chagrined researchers, who’d started in surprise at the sudden interruption and command, set the large metal spoon down and got out their wands to begin putting up the precautions.  Harry nodded severely.</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">When he returned to her side, he said, “Yes… it’s been necessary for a long time.  You came to me after the bombing in Diagon Alley with Tonks, and you both were right, then.  I’ve been waiting because… well, the time wasn’t right.”</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">As they entered the meeting room, Hermione closed the door behind them, and glanced around.  They were alone.</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">“No,” she said, leaning against the door.  “I know.  I know you haven’t been trying to stop Draco and Narcissa.”</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Harry controlled his reaction.  He’d been expecting this.  He limited himself to nodding, thoughtfully, as he walked over to the big table.</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">She crossed her arms, and went on.  “I even understand the reasons behind it.  But what I </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">don’t</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> understand is why you wouldn’t tell me.  Why you’d keep it a secret.”</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">He sighed.  </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">I knew this was coming.  Another reason to step up more obvious aggressive action… it’s becoming apparent that we’re not really taking on the Honourable.  We move hard to advance our own interests, but barely do anything to restrain the Malfoys.</span></em><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">“I wanted to control the game… I wanted </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">one</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> game, as much as could manage,” Harry said.  “World politics was too balkanized, with too many separate sets of interests.  The States and most of the rest of the Americas are all about advancing their own power and pushing back against the ‘British imperialism’ that they think has been dominating the world since Merlin.  I mean, not that they’re wrong, but…”  He shrugged.  “Europe is a muddle of old feuds, like Cappadocia and Cyprus… the Sawad and Africa splinter into different factions on a regular basis… and the Ten Thousand are-- well, I don’t actually understand what’s going on between the twelve of them.”</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">“Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres,” said Hermione, sharply, “if you dare to try to explain the basics of game theory to me, I am going to be rather cross with you.  I can see </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">why </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">you did it: you wanted to create a conflict game where there are only two sides -- and as close to zero-sum as you could get.  I’m going to leave aside the arrogance of trying to manipulate world politics on this scale -- I mean, honestly, the Cold War version of this left the world with thousands of nuclear bombs! -- and just say that you </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">should have told me</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">.”</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Harry faced away from her for a long moment, staring at the glossy wood of the table.  He leaned on it, and thought about what to say.</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s not that I don’t trust you.  I trust you </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">implicitly</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">,” he said, still gazing at his own reflection in the table’s surface.  “You’re intuitively good… I have to think through utility functions and weigh the benefits, but you… you carry goodness around like pennies in your pocket.  Not that intuition is the best way to get correct utilitarian results, but… I have to admit your record on moral decisions is a lot better than mine.  Results matter.  So it’s not that… it’s not trust.”  He paused.  “But you and Draco were… close.”</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">He heard Hermione about to speak behind him, as she drew in a breath.</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s not what I mean,” he said hastily, turning around.  Her eyes were bright and fixed on him, as if she could pin him to the floor and wrest out his secrets with the intensity of her scrutiny.  “But you spent a lot of time together, after our first year.  I know he really helped you, when you couldn’t get the-- when you had trouble with the Patronus.”  Her gaze stayed steady.  “And you’re so open and clear to everyone… it’s why you’ve been so effective at convincing people to join the Treaty for Health and Life.”</span><br>
<br>
<em><span style="font-weight: 400;">But you’re terrible at deception.  You never had to learn it: you have always won by sheer dint of cleverness and hard work.  You’ve gotten a little better at dissembling and lying as you’ve become more of a politician, but carrying on a charade where we were working our hardest to crush the Honourable threat?  I couldn’t risk it.  People like Reg Hig would see through you after a single conversation.</span></em><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">But none of that was the right thing to say.  You can’t convince someone out of their feelings like that… it ended up sounding like you were saying that their feelings were wrong or illegitimate.  Even if you succeeded in reasoning someone out of all of their objections, you didn’t make them feel better or repair the breach.  He’d learned, all too well, that emotions could overwhelm everything else, in the moment.  </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you get past that, and get on with it, you can get back to being rational and</span></em><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">“No,” Hermione said, firmly, as though she knew exactly what he was thinking.  “I am not a delicate flower, and I am not an irrational woman overcome by my past and my emotions, and I am not standing on a bloody pedestal while you take the hard decisions on yourself.  I’m not--”  She paused, seeming to think of something else for a moment, then added, “I’m not a bloody pawn in your game.”  She walked towards him until she was only a pace away, her jaw rigid with anger.  Harry became aware that he’d leaned back against the table away from her, without being conscious of it.</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">“But after Granville, you were… I mean, you’re out there all the time, open to attack and facing the public, and--” he said, starting and restarting his explanations.</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Hermione reached to the table next to him, took hold with a few fingers, and casually twisted.  The beveled edge of the wood, fully an inch thick, snapped off with a loud cracking noise.  She shifted the thick chunk to her palm, and ground it to splinters with a few motions of her hand.  Broken pieces of the destroyed fragment of table pattered to the floor like rain.</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">“And I’m too fragile?”  She opened her hand, releasing a scattering of dust.  Her voice was bitter, arch contempt underlying every syllable.  “You didn’t tell me about your proposed plan because you didn’t think I’d be able to handle it… because you thought I’d be in a conference in France or Germany or America, and someone would ask why we weren’t cracking down on the Honourable, and I’d muff it.  Because you don’t think of me as a full equal.  I’m your equal only on very specific terms… spellcraft and tactics and combat and ethics.  But when it comes to the big decisions on strategy?  You only trust your own judgment, even after everything.  That’s the only real reason for this.  You’re the Dumbledore, </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">watching over me</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and I’m the child.”</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">“I-- I’m… I’m sorry, I--”  He felt overwhelmed, and wanted to protest, </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">No, no, that’s not true… we’re full partners</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but he was too well-trained in the art of avoiding avoidance, and so he was already critically assessing his own thought processes, and wondering if she was right about all of that, and he had the sickening suspicion that she was.  If someone is your full partner, you don’t use a grand strategy that leaves them in the dark.  That’s what you do with subordinates.  Which was how he’d been treating her… in this, anyway.</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m going to stop Draco from dragging any more people into his nasty little Treaty of Let People Die, don’t worry about that,” Hermione said, as she jabbed a finger into his chest.  She was being gentle, he knew, since it didn’t hurt him.  Even as she felt betrayed, she was gentle with him.  He felt like an unbelievable jackass.</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">She stalked out of the room, pausing only to say one last thing.</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">“Voldemort didn’t think he had any equals, either.”</span><br>
